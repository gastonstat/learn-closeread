In his book __Fluke__, chapter-7 "The Storytelling Animal", social scientist and author Brian Klaas provides a captivating description of our narrative-addicted minds.

At the end of page 135, Brian writes: [@cr-prose1]{scale-by="2"}

Aha! the key word: _story_ [@cr-prose1]{scale-by="2" highlight="cr-story"}

And the main question: [@cr-prose1]{scale-by="2" highlight="cr-question"}

:::{#cr-prose1}
| Our beliefs are most easily swayed 
| [when ideas are put into a story]{#cr-story}. 
| Generation after generation, 
| from our earliest days, 
| humans accumulated wisdom 
| to make sense of the world. 
| But how could that wisdom
| [reverberate between generations?]{#cr-question}
:::

To answer that question, Klaas quotes neuroscientist Antonio Damasio: [@cr-prose2]{scale-by="2"}

Storytelling! [@cr-prose2]{scale-by="2" highlight="cr-answer"}

:::{#cr-prose2}
| "The problem of how to make 
| all this wisdom understandable, 
| transmittable, persuasive, enforceable
| ---of how to make it stick---
| was faced and a solution found. 
| [Storytelling was the solution."]{#cr-answer}
:::

Of course. [@cr-prose2]{scale-by="2"}

A few lines later, Brian continues: [@cr-prose3]{scale-by="2"}

:::{#cr-prose3}
| Our brains are so attuned to narrative 
| that we will connect the dots into a story 
| even when the dots aren't connected, 
| which is called _narrative bias_. 
| When we are given a snippet 
| of incomplete information, 
| the pattern-processing networks 
| within our skulls fill in the gaps.
:::

Our brains crave for narrative! We are wired to form and create stories 
even when there are none.

Later on, in the same page, Brian quotes Barbara Hardy: [@cr-prose4]{scale-by="2"}

:::{#cr-prose4}
| We "dream in narrative, 
| daydream in narrative, 
| remember, anticipate, 
| hope, despair, 
| believe, doubt, 
| plan, revise, 
| criticize, construct, 
| gossip, learn,
| hate and live by narrative."
:::

Basically, we are narrative-driven creatures; whether it is talking to others or to ourselves, or also listening to others or to our inner voice; whether it is while we are awake or also while we sleep.

And finally, Brian cites Jonathan Gottschall and his famous _storytelling animal_ [@cr-prose5]{scale-by="2"}

:::{#cr-prose5}
| We are ... [a storytelling animal.]{#cr-animal} 
| "The storytelling mind 
| is allergic to uncertainty,
| randomness, and coincidence.
| It is addicted to meaning."
:::

That's what we are. [@cr-prose5]{scale-by="2" highlight="cr-animal"} 

In essence, that's what makes us humans. [@cr-prose5]{scale-by="2"}
