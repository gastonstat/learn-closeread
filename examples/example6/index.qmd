# On The Storytelling Animal
:::

:::{#cr-story}

:::

In his book __The Storytelling Animal__, American author and literary scholar Jonathan Gottschall seeks to provide a unified theory of storytelling.

In the preamble, Jonathan writes: [@cr-prose0]{scale-by="2"}

:::{#cr-prose0}
| While your body is always fixed 
| at a particular point in space-time, 
| your mind is always free 
| to ramble in lands of make-believe.
:::

Gottschall wants to understand why are humans addicted to stories? How did humans become the storytelling animal?


It is worth mentioning that the title of the Gottschall's book comes from the following passage of Graham Swift's 1983 novel _Waterland_ [@cr-waterland]{scale-by="1.5"} 

:::{#cr-waterland}
| Man---let me offer you a definition---
| is the storytelling animal.
| Wherever he goes he wants to leave behind
| not a chaotic wake, not an empty space,
| but the comforting maker buoys 
| and trail signs of stories.
|
| _Graham Swift_

:::{focus-on="cr-fluke"}
Political scientist and author Brian Klaas borrows the notion of the _Storytelling Animal_ in his 2024 book __Fluke__.
<br>
<br>
The main thesis in Fluke is about how small chance events can divert our lives and change everything.

In chapter-7 "The Storytelling Animal", Klaas provides a captivating description of our narrative-addicted minds.

At the end of page 135, Brian writes: [@cr-prose1]{scale-by="2"}

Aha! the key word: _story_ [@cr-prose1]{scale-by="2" highlight="cr-story"}

And the main question: [@cr-prose1]{scale-by="2" highlight="7-8"}


:::{#cr-prose1}
| Our beliefs are most easily swayed 
| [when ideas are put into a story]{#cr-story}. 
| Generation after generation, 
| from our earliest days, 
| humans accumulated wisdom 
| to make sense of the world. 
| But how could that wisdom
| reverberate between generations?
:::

To answer that question, Klaas quotes neuroscientist Antonio Damasio: [@cr-prose2]{scale-by="2"}

Storytelling! [@cr-prose2]{scale-by="2" highlight="cr-answer"}

:::{#cr-prose2}
| "The problem of how to make 
| all this wisdom understandable, 
| transmittable, persuasive, enforceable
| ---of how to make it stick---
| was faced and a solution found. 
| [Storytelling was the solution."]{#cr-answer}
|
| _Antonio Damasio_
:::

Of course. [@cr-prose2]{scale-by="2"}

A few lines later, Brian continues: [@cr-prose3]{scale-by="2"}

:::{#cr-prose3}
| Our brains are so attuned to narrative 
| that we will connect the dots into a story 
| even when the dots aren't connected, 
| which is called _narrative bias_. 
| When we are given a snippet 
| of incomplete information, 
| the pattern-processing networks 
| within our skulls fill in the gaps.
:::

Our brains crave for narrative! We are wired to form and create stories 
even when there are none.

Later on, in the same page, Brian quotes Barbara Hardy: [@cr-prose4]{scale-by="2"}

:::{#cr-prose4}
| We "dream in narrative, 
| daydream in narrative, 
| remember, anticipate, 
| hope, despair, 
| believe, doubt, 
| plan, revise, 
| criticize, construct, 
| gossip, learn,
| hate and live by narrative."
|
| _Barbara Hardy_
:::

Basically, we are narrative-driven creatures; whether it is talking to others or to ourselves, or also listening to others or to our inner voice; whether it is while we are awake or also while we sleep.

And finally, Brian Klaas cites Jonathan Gottschall and his famous _storytelling animal_ [@cr-prose5]{scale-by="2"}

:::{#cr-prose5}
| We are ... [a storytelling animal.]{#cr-animal2} 
| "The storytelling mind 
| is allergic to uncertainty,
| randomness, and coincidence.
| It is addicted to meaning."
:::

That's what we are. [@cr-prose5]{scale-by="2" highlight="cr-animal2"} 

In essence, that's what makes us humans. [@cr-prose5]{scale-by="2"}
