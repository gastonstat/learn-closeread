On a cloudy 2013 Spring day, in one my of my monthly trips to Paris, I found this eye-catching bicycle parked outside a store in _Ile Saint-Louis_, one of the two islands in the Seine river. @cr-bike

I had never seen a bicycle so colorful, and originally decorated, with a distinctive personality of its own.

The shape and size of the <span style="color:#fe964c">__orange__</span> panniers---with their <span style="color:#f8566c">__pink__</span> straps---reminded me of my childhood years and the bags that I used to carry when I was in kindergarten. [@cr-bike]{pan-to="10%,0%" scale-by="1.4"}

The frame of the bike is very interesting. Its exposed parts (the chain and seat stays) show the pass of time with rusted areas, and what I assume is its original <span style="color:#4c5d4d">__dark green__</span> color. [@cr-bike]{pan-to="0%,10%" scale-by="1.7"}

The rest of the frame is wrapped around various threads of colorful yarns: 
<br>
- <span style="color:#ec6a96">__pink__</span> in the section under the saddle, <br>
- a fluffy <span style="color:#c0a344">__green__</span> surrounding the top tube, <br>
- a <span style="color:#e1553e">__multicolor__</span> yarn around both the down and the head tubes. 

The handle bar is wrapped in <span style="color:#f48653">__orange__</span>, and the headset section in <span style="color:#17b6c3">__cyan__</span>. It even has a mesh containing more ball of yarns hanging from the right handle. Likewise, it also has a headlight mounted on the front fender. [@cr-bike]{pan-to="-25%,20%" scale-by="1.7"}

The whole thing is supported on its kickstand. [@cr-bike]{pan-to="0%,-30%" scale-by="1.7"}

What a whimsical bicycle and---I would dare to say---a wonderful piece of street art. @cr-bike
