On a cloudy Spring day of 2013, walking down the narrow streets of _Ile Saint-Louis_ in Paris, I stumbled upon an eye-catching bicycle. It was begging me to take a picture of it. @cr-bike

I had never seen such a colorful bicycle, so originally decorated, with a distinctive personality of its own. [@cr-bike]{scale-by="1.4"}

The shape and size of the <span style="color:#fe964c">__orange__</span> panniers---with their <span style="color:#f8566c">__pink__</span> straps---reminded me of my childhood years and the leather bags I used to carry when I was in kindergarten. [@cr-bike]{pan-to="10%,20%" scale-by="1.8"}

The frame of the bike was very interesting. Its exposed parts (the chain and seat stays) showed the pass of time with <span style="color:#a03a08">__rusted__</span> areas, and what I assume was its original <span style="color:#426245">__dark green__</span> color. [@cr-bike]{pan-to="-5%,25%" scale-by="1.9"}

The rest of the frame was wrapped around various threads of colorful yarns: 
<br>
<br>
- <span style="color:#ec6a96">__pink__</span> in the section under the saddle,
<br>
<br>
- a fluffy <span style="color:#c0a344">__green__</span> surrounding the top tube,
<br>
<br>
- a <strong><span style="color:#e1553e">mul</span><span style="color:#e19c85">ti</span><span style="color:#c0293b">co</span><span style="color:#e1553e">lor</span></strong> yarn around both the down and the head tubes. 


The handle bar was wrapped in <span style="color:#f48653">__orange__</span>, and the headset section in <span style="color:#17b6c3">__aquamarine__</span>. Hanging from its right handle, it even had a <span style="color:#fb6457">__coral__</span> mesh bag containing more ball of yarns.
<br>
<br>
Likewise, it also had a headlight mounted on the front fender. [@cr-bike]{pan-to="-15%,30%" scale-by="2"}

The whole thing was supported on its kickstand. [@cr-bike]{pan-to="0%,-30%" scale-by="1.9"}

What a whimsical bicycle and---in my humble opinion---a wonderful piece of street Parisian art. [@cr-bike]{scale-by="1.3"}
