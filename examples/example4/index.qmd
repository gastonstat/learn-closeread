By the time you finish elementary school, you know a little. @cr-phd2

:::{#cr-phd2}
![](phd_002.jpg)
:::


By the time you finish high school, you know a bit more. @cr-phd3

:::{#cr-phd3}
![](phd_003.jpg)
:::


With a bachelor's degree, you gain a specialty. @cr-phd4

:::{#cr-phd4}
![](phd_004.jpg)
:::


A master's degree deepens that specialty. @cr-phd5

:::{#cr-phd5}
![](phd_005.jpg)
:::


Reading research papers takes you to the edge of human knowledge. @cr-phd6

:::{#cr-phd6}
![](phd_006.jpg)
:::


Once you're at the boundary, you focus. @cr-phd7

:::{#cr-phd7}

You push at the boundary for a few years. [@cr-phd8]{scale-by="1.5"}

:::{#cr-phd8}

:::


Until one day, the boundary gives way. [@cr-phd9]{scale-by="1.5"}

:::{#cr-phd9}
![](phd_009.jpg)
:::


And, that dent you've made is called a Ph.D. [@cr-phd10]{scale-by="1.5"}

:::{#cr-phd10}
![](phd_010.jpg)
:::


Of course, the world looks different to you now. [@cr-phd11]{scale-by="1.4"}

:::{#cr-phd11}
![](phd_011.jpg)
:::


So, don't forget the bigger picture. @cr-phd12
