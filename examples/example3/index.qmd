Suppose you have some amount of money $P$, 
and you'll invest it for $n$ 
years, obtaining an annual return $r$.

How much money will you have $n$ years from now?

To find the answer you have to calculate the __Future Value__ 
given by the following formula: @cr-fv

:::{#cr-fv}
$$
FV = P \times (1 + r)^n
$$
:::

$FV$ is the Future Value

$P$ is the Principal, the amount of money you'll invest.

$r$ is the annual interest rate, or rate of return.

$n$ is the number of years.


What would be the future value of $10,000 invested for 10 years, 
assuming an annual return of 7%? @cr-investment

:::{#cr-investment}
\begin{align*}
P &= 10,000 \\
& \\
r &= 0.07 \\
& \\
n &= 10
\end{align*}
:::

Let's do the math: @cr-math

:::{#cr-math}
\begin{align*}
FV &= 10,000 \times (1 + 0.07)^{10} \\
   &
\end{align*}
:::

The answer is: @cr-answer

:::{#cr-answer}
\begin{align*}
FV &= 10,000 \times (1 + 0.07)^{10} \\
   &= 19,671.51
\end{align*}
