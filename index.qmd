## Welcome

My goal with this website is to help you learn about __Closeread__, a 
[Quarto](https://quarto.org) extension to create scrollytelling stories with 
your HTML documents. I've organized the content into 2 major sections:

- [Modules](modules): a series of topics and discussions about the large number
of things you can do with Closeread.

- [Examples](examples): live demos of the examples discussed in the modules.

To stay up to date with the latest and greatest features of Closeread, and/or 
to know more about technical details not covered in this website, please visit
Closeread's official website: <a href="https://closeread.dev/" target="_blank">closeread.dev</a>


## A few words about scrollytelling

The word _scrollytelling_ is a modification of the term _storytelling_. 
It is basically a mix of the words "scrolling" and "storytelling".

A quick search of scrollytelling on google gives the following AI answer:

> Scrollytelling is a web design technique that uses visual and 
> textual elements to tell a story as the reader scrolls through a page.

Here's how it works.
As you scroll through a webpage, elements such as text, images, video, or audio
appear, move, disappear, or change. This gives you a sense of discovery and 
exploration, often with an element of surprise and awe.

Scrollytelling can help readers focus on a certain part or element of your story.
It lets you present information in chunks, so that it is more digestible
to your audience. It also allows you to set the pace from one bit of information
to the next one.


## Demo

You know the old saying, _"the proof of the pudding is in the eating"_. So here's
an appetizer of Closeread with this personal example in which I 
illustrate the difference between theory and practice when carrying out a 
Data Analysis Process:


::::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center" style="font-size: 1.5em;"}

@cr-dap1
| How to carry out a data analysis process?

@cr-dap2
| This is the way the mythical gods do it. 

@cr-dap3
| What about the rest of us mere mortals?

@cr-dap4
| This is the way ...

@cr-dap5
| ... the rest of us ...

@cr-dap6
| ... struggles to do it.
