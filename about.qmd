I first heard of __Closeread__ at the end of August 2024 in one of my meetings 
with Andrew Bray, when we were preparing for the beginning of the Fall semester
and getting ready to teach STAT 20 "Introduction to Probability and Statistics", 
at UC Berkeley.

I don't recall the exact details for how our conversation drifted to a tangential
topic related with one of my favorite subjects: Data Visualization. The important
thing is that Andrew briefly mentioned this thing called Closeread. He told
me it was a quarto extension, but didn't say much else about it. Instead, he 
opened a new tab in his browser, typed in some url, and _voila_, there it was
on his big screen mounted on the wall:
a [live demo](https://closeread.dev/gallery/examples/auden-poem/) of Closeread 
based on an article from The New York Times (NYT)  that had captivated Andrew 
two years prior which started it all off:

I was not familiar with this particular article from NYT, but I was definitely 
aware of the _scrollytelling_ feature used in many other NYT articles, especially
in those data-journalism articles involving graphics and data visualizations.

I should say I didn't know the existence of this term: __scrollytelling__. Andrew
didn't mention it in our meeting. I knew what it looked like, and its visual
effect on HTML documents, I just didn't know there was a word for it.

Fast forward three months later, in the middle of November, I received an email 
from Andrew in which he was going to give a workshop on Closeread to be held 
on Wednesday November-20th, at 5pm in one of the classrooms in the 3rd floor of [Evans hall](https://www.berkeley.edu/map/evans-hall/).

I was one of 25 or so participants that attended the workshop that evening,
and probably one of the few ones who had heard of Closeread and seen it first 
hand in action already. 

I got immediately hooked by Closeread's simplicity. Yes, there were various
technical details, tricky concepts, and of course some jargon involved. 
But I was sold into this tool right away. 

At the beginning of the workshop Andrew asked participants to briefly 
introduced themselves and to say why they were interested in the workshop. 
My reason---I told everyone---was to learn about Closeread so that I could 
teach it in my STAT 133 course (an introductory-to-intermediate level course 
on data analysis using R, RStudio, Quarto ecosystem, and other computational tools).

My answer was a very honest one, and I truly meant it. But if I wanted to teach 
Closeread and help spread it out, first I had to learn how to use it. 
And this is how this website came out to be.
