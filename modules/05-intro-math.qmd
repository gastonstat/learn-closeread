title: "5) Scrollytelling with Equations"
---

So far we've introduced a couple of basic Closeread documents. Our first
example used only text. Our second example involved text and images. But
what about including some code in our scrollytelling story? In this module, 
we show you a third basic example that involves text and some R code.

## Reminder

Recall that you need to have installed the quarto Closeread extension in your 
working directory. Run the following command in your Terminal:

```{.markdown filename="Terminal"}
quarto add qmd-lab/closeread
```
:::


## Example

Below is an example of a qmd file with some content. Copy and paste it into a
qmd document so that you can preview it or render it in all its Closeread glory.

```{.markdown filename="example4.qmd"}

This is a scrollytelling story containing 
some math equations written with LaTeX.

::::{.cr-section}

Suppose you have some amount of money $P$, 
and you'll invest it for $n$ 
years, obtaining an annual return $r$.

How much money will you have $n$ years from now?

To find the answer you have to calculate the __Future Value__ 
given by the following formula: @cr-fv

:::{#cr-fv}
$$
FV = P \times (1 + r)^n
$$
:::

$FV$ is the Future Value

$P$ is the Principal, the amount of money you'll invest.

$r$ is the annual interest rate, or rate of return.

$n$ is the number of years.


What would be the future value of $10,000 invested for 10 years, 
assuming an annual return of 7%? @cr-investment

:::{#cr-investment}
\begin{align*}
P &= 10,000 \\
& \\
r &= 0.07 \\
& \\
n &= 10
\end{align*}
:::

Let's do the math: @cr-math

:::{#cr-math}
\begin{align*}
FV &= 10,000 \times (1 + 0.07)^{10} \\
   &
\end{align*}
:::

The answer is: @cr-answer

:::{#cr-answer}
\begin{align*}
FV &= 10,000 \times (1 + 0.07)^{10} \\
   &= 19,671.51
\end{align*}
