title: "9) Style Formatting"
---

In this module, you'll learn about the __style formatting__ or guidelines that
dictate how a Closeread document should look. The goal is to describe the 
different formatting options available in Closeread to customize the visual 
appearance of elements such as the background of a cr-section, the font of the 
text in stickies, as well as the format of the narrative elements.


## Introduction

As you know, Closeread documents come with default settings that give them 
a rudimentary look. Personally, I find the default format to be quite limited,
and I don't think I would ever create a Closeread document without tuning 
its overall look.

The good news is that you can customize various aspects of the main components
in a Closeread document. I should say that the catalog of customization 
styles is rather narrow, but the provided options can take you very far if you 
understand their roles and the values they can take.

Currently, there is about a dozen of formatting options available in Closeread,
and most of them have to do with styling of narrative components, which in
turn depend on the type of layout (e.g. sidebar or overlay).

One important thing to keep in mind is that a Closeread document will generally
follow the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html" target="_blank">Quarto theme</a> you use. 
If you don't specify a theme, then the <a href="https://bootswatch.com/default/" target="_blank">default theme</a> will be used. To further customize your 
Closeread document, you can always add your own CSS or SCSS stylesheets.


### How to customize formatting styles

Customizing formatting options is a fairly straightforward process. All you have
to do is specify the desired option in the `cr-style` key, in the yaml header
(or frontmatter). 

For example, say we are using a sidebar layout (default layout) 
and we want to change the background color of the sidebar to black, and also
set the color of the narrative text to white---expressed in hexadecimal notation
`#ffffff`. This is done as follows:

```yaml
---
title: "Hello Closeread"
format:
  closeread-html:
    cr-style:
      narrative-background-color-sidebar: black
      narrative-text-color-sidebar: "#ffffff"
---
```



I've found it easy to describe the different formatting options depending on 
what type of layout you are using: sidebar -vs- overlay. This is why I've 
decided to describe them in their own sections---see sections below---based on
the chosen layout.


## Styling Sidebar Layouts

The following figure illustrates the appearance of a rendered document using
__sidebar layout__. I've superimposed the different formatting options to indicate
what elements can be affected by them.

![Figure 9.1](images/style-sidebar.svg){width="75%"}

- `section-background-color`: the background color used for Closeread sections.

- `narrative-background-color-sidebar`: the background color used for the narrative column (in sidebar layouts).

- `narrative-text-color-sidebar`: the color of narrative text (in sidebar layouts).

- `narrative-sidebar-width`: the width of the sidebar. Defaults to `1fr`: the sticky content is `2fr` in sidebar layouts, dividing the page 1:2 by default. You can adjust this ratio with a different `fr` value, a fixed value, or a combination of the two using [`minmax()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/minmax).

- `narrative-font-family`: the font(s) used for narrative content (regardless of the chosen layout).

- `narrative-font-size`: the font size used for narrative content (regardless of the chosen layout).

- `poem-font-family`: the font(s) used for lineblock poems (i.e. in sticky elements).


Here's a hypothetical example of what the yaml header of a `qmd` file could look 
like if you were to customize all the formatting options listed above:

```yaml
---
title: "Hello Closeread"
format:
  closeread-html:
    cr-style:
      section-background-color: "#f7f6f5"
      narrative-background-color-sidebar: "#525252"
      narrative-sidebar-width: minmax(400px, 1fr)
      narrative-text-color-sidebar: "#ffffff"
      narrative-font-family: 'Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif'
      narrative-font-size: 2em
      poem-font-family: 'Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif'
---
```

## Styling Overlay Layouts

The following figure illustrates the appearance of a rendered document using
__overlay layout__. I've superimposed the different formatting options to indicate
what elements can be affected by them.

![Figure 9.2](images/style-overlay.svg){width="67%"}



- `narrative-background-color-overlay`: the background color used for narrative text blocks (of overlay layouts).

- `narrative-text-color-overlay`: the color of narrative text (for overlay layouts).

- `narrative-border-radius`: the border radius of narrative text blocks (for overlay layouts).

- `narrative-overlay-max-width`: the maximum width of narrative text blocks (for overlay layouts).

- `narrative-overlay-min-width`: the minimum width of narrative text blocks (for 
overlay layouts). The recommendation is to leave this one alone because setting 
it can cause mobile layout issues.

- `narrative-outer-margin`: the margin pushing narrative content in from the left (on overlay-left layouts) or right edge (on overlay-right)

- `narrative-font-size`: the font size used for narrative content (regardless of the chosen layout).

- `poem-font-family`: the font(s) used for lineblock poems (i.e. in sticky elements).

- `section-background-color`: the background color used for Closeread sections.


Here's a hypothetical example of what the yaml header of a `qmd` file could look 
like if you were to customize all the formatting options listed above:

```yaml
---
title: "Hello Closeread"
format:
  closeread-html:
    cr-style:
      section-background-color: "#f7f6f5"
      narrative-background-color-overlay: "#525252"
      narrative-overlay-min-width: "300px"
      narrative-overlay-max-width: "600px"
      narrative-outer-margin: "#ffffff"
      narrative-font-family: 'Arial, sans-serif'
      narrative-font-size: 2em
      poem-font-family: ', "Times New Roman", Times, serif'
---
```
