title: "8) Layout Options"
---

In this module you'll learn about the various layout options available in 
Closeread.

There are five layout options:

- sidebar-left
- sidebar-right
- overlay-left
- overlay-center
- overlay-right


## Specifying a layout

How do you specify a layout? This is done in 2+1 ways:

- In the yaml header, with the field `layout:` under the `cr-section` key:

```yaml
format:
  closeread-html:
    cr-section:
      layout: "sidebar-right"
```

- At the __cr-section__ level

```{.markdown}
:::{.cr-section layout="sidebar-right"}
< Content of the section, including stickies and narrative blocks >
:::
```

- At both the yaml and cr-section levels:

```{.markdown}
---
format:
  closeread-html:
    cr-section:
      layout: "overlay-left"
---

:::{.cr-section1}
< first section using overlay-left >
:::


:::{.cr-section2 layout="overlay-center"}
< second section using overlay-center >
:::

:::{.cr-section3 layout="overlay-right"}
< third section using overlay-right >
:::
```



## Sidebar Layouts

Closeread provides two flavors of sidebar layout: sidebar left and sidebar
right. As a matter of fact, the default layout is the sidebar left.

The following diagram shows the appearance of both types of sidebar layouts. 
For sake of clarity I've added a couple of auxiliary boxes (in sky-blue and
mint-green) to indicate the narrative texts, as well as a dashed line that 
marks the separation of the sidebar from the section of the sticky components.
Keep in mind that these auxiliary visuals won't show up in the actual rendered
HTML document.

## Overlay Layouts

In addition to the sidebar layout, Closeread also gives you three flavors of
__overlay layouts__: overlay left, overlay center, and overlay right.

The following diagram shows the appearance of the 3 types of overlay layouts. 
Observe that the narrative elements appear inside their own boxes, with a 
darker background---and some transparency---and text in white font.

## Header Space

Closeread also gives you the option to remove the header space, that is, the
space at the top of the document for the title block. To remove this space you
use the `remove-header-space` option in the document yaml header

```yaml
---
format:
  closeread-html:
    remove-header-space: true
---
```

Removing the header space is often a good idea if your entire document is
one large Closeread section. If that is the case, you may also be interested
in disabling the Quarto sidebar.
