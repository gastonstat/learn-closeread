title: "10) Story with Illustrations"

This module is associated with the example [The Illustrated Guide to a Ph.D.](../examples/example4)

The example in the above link is a Closeread story based on one of my favorite 
blog posts written by Matt Might: The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.

In the process of learning and experimenting with Closeread, I was looking for
a simple, yet captivating, example of a story with a highly visual nature. 
And that's when my brain, somewhat unexpectedly, was able to remember 
Matt's illustrated guide to a Ph.D. 

The original post is in the following link which, if you haven't visited before,
I highly encourage you to do it right now:

The figure below doesn't do justice to the actual aspect of Matt's post, but I'm
including it here so that you can have a bird's eye view of the entire story.

![Fig 10.2) The 12 images and sentences of an illustrated guide to a Ph.D.](images/cr-story-phd2.png)

As you can tell, the illustrated guide to a Ph.D. is a beautifully distilled 
series of 12 illustrations and sentences explaining what a Ph.D. is all about.

As soon as I went back to check Matt's post, I knew immediately that this was 
a perfect fit to test Closeread's features, and therefore I decided to clone 
it as my first Closeread proof-of-concept.


### A Visual Story in 12 Images 

Let me tell you a bit about my shameless cloning adventure. First, I downloaded 
the 12 images (i.e. the associated 12 JPG files) to the same directory of the 
`qmd` file that I used for this Closeread story.

Then I frenetically typed---including copied-and-pasted---the content of the 
story, and specified the structure of the closeread components (e.g. section, 
stickies, and triggers).

The content of the `qmd` file is fairly simple. Below is an excerpt of the
closeread-section with the first four sentences, the first four triggers,
and the corresponding first four stickies. As you can tell, each sticky 
involves a JPG image.


```{.markdown}
::::{.cr-section}

Imagine a circle that contains all of human knowledge. @cr-phd1

:::{#cr-phd1}
![](phd_001.jpg)
:::


By the time you finish elementary school, you know a little. @cr-phd2

By the time you finish high school, you know a bit more. @cr-phd3

With a bachelor's degree, you gain a specialty. @cr-phd4

<ETC>

```


### Adapting dimensions of some images

All the first 7 images have the same dimensions, and visually they all 
correspond to the circle that contains all of human knowledge.

Compared to the first 7 images, illustrations 8 to 11 are different. These 
images depict zooming-in to the frontier of human knowledge (i.e. the border of 
the circle). Because these images have different dimensions that the first 
seven diagrams, I had to modify their `width` and `height` dimensions. The 
following snippet shows the 8th sentence and the 8th sticky. Notice the 
dimension attributes of the image.

### Layout and Format

The layout of this Closeread story is the default one: `layout: sidebar-left`.

However, there are some non-default formatting styles:

- the background color of the cr-section is white,

- the background color of the sidebar is black,

- the color of the narrative text is white,

- the font-size of the narrative text is set to 1.8em,

- the font-family of the narrative text uses a serif font.

All of these formatting details are specified in the yaml header:

```yaml
