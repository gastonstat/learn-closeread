title: "7) Default Layout"
---

In this module you'll learn about the structure of the default layout used by
Closeread. Because the preceding module was fairly long, I've decided to keep
the current module short in order to give you a preamble of the other layout 
options discussed in the next module.


## Introduction

Consider a simple quarto document `example.qmd` with the following content:

```{.markdown filename="example.qmd"}
---
title: Hello Closeread
format: closeread-html
---

::::{.cr-section}

This is a short demo.

Introductory text with no trigger.

Triggering text @cr-sticky

:::{#cr-sticky}
| The quick
| brown fox
| jumps over
| the lazy dog
:::

::::
```

When you render `example.qmd`, you'll get an HTML document
with the following appearance (see figure below):

![Figure 7.1) Rendered document with default layout  "sidebar-left"](images/layout-sections-invisible.svg)

By default, Closeread uses a layout called `"sidebar-left"` which, as its
name indicates, places the narrative components on the __left hand-side__ of 
the screen, while the sticky components are displayed on the right hand side. 
To the naked eye, however, it's impossible to see where
exactly all the sections begin and end.


## Visualizing Layout Sections

Although it's impossible to see the exact areas of the narrative and the 
stickies, the good news is that it is possible to visualize them by turning on 
the __debug mode__ by adding the `debug-mode` option in the yaml header:

```yaml
---
title: Hello Closeread!
format: closeread-html
debug-mode: true
---
```

When you activate debugging mode, and re-render the quarto document, you'll
discover the various parts in which the HTML document is integrated. 
Specifically, you'll see the individual narrative sections, as well as a dotted 
horizontal line spanning the entire width of the screen, as depicted in the
diagram shown below:

![Figure 7.2) Layout displayed in debug-mode](images/layout-sections-visible.svg)

As you can tell, there is a rectangular section with a sky-blue background.
This is the box of the first narrative text that has no trigger. Right below
this section there is another box with a mint-green background; this
is the region of the second narrative text which has a trigger. What about the
dotted horizontal line? That's the threshold line that marks when a narrative
component (and possibly an associated sticky) should become active. As you 
scroll down the document, the moment the mint-green section crosses the dotted 
line, the second narrative text and the sticky component appear on the screen.

As I said, the default layout in Closeread is `"sidebar-left"`, but there 
are other layout options. Read on to learn about the rest of the layout
flavors in the next module.
