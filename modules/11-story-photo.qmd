You can use Closeread to tell a photo-based story. And this is precisely what I 
did for the above example.

Searching among my collection of digital albums, I dug up this old photo of
a unique bicycle that I took more than a decade ago when I spent a year living
in France.


## Deciding the Visual Journey

I wanted to take the viewer through a visual journey, traversing some of the
parts in the bicycle that I found interesting. To be more precise, I wanted
to concentrate on the colorful elements of the bike.


### Focal Points

After some careful inspection of the bike structure, and the way its elements
were decorated, I decided to choose about 10 parts, which are highlighted 
in yellow polygons in the figure below. They were basically:

- the panniers
- the various parts of the frame, especially those wrapped in yarns
- the saddle
- the headlight
- and the kickstand

### Panning Order

Given the angle and perspective in which I took the photo, and also the position
in which the bicycle is standing, I also opted for a lateral movement from
left to right (1, 2, and 3), and then a small down-backward movement to the 
kickstand (4). All of this required the use and combination of various 
`pan-to` and `scale-by` focus effects.

### Some touches of color in the narrative

As I was working on this story, having written the main text of the narrative, 
and having assembled the closeread components (section, stickies, triggers),
the voice of my inner visual designer kept murmuring that there was something
missing. In particular, it was about the visual appearance of the narrative text. 
I felt that the color of the text was missing some connection with all the 
colors in the photo. 

The main question I faced was: How can I or what can I do 
to visually tighten the narrative with the specific colored parts of the bike 
that I want the viewer to draw their attention to?

I found the answer to this question by adding color to the words naming the
colors. For example, when talking about "the __orange__ panniers" I colored
the word _orange_, so that text looked 
"the <span style="color:#fe964c">__orange__</span> panniers." Similarly with 
the "pink straps" I colored _pink_ so that it looked as 
"<span style="color:#f8566c">__pink__</span> straps."

To change the color of a given word or set of characters I used a bit of HTML
syntax with `<span>` marks and specifying a color to the attribute `style`:

```html
the <span style="color:#fe964c">__orange__</span> panniers
```

Notice the use of hexadecimal values, e.g. `#fe964c`, when specifying the 
name of a color. You can also use standard names such as `red`, `blue`, or
`green`, but I prefer to use hex-colors.


### Layout and Format

The layout of this Closeread story is the default one: `layout: sidebar-left`.

However, there are some non-default formatting styles:

- the background color of the cr-section is white,

- the background color of the sidebar is `"#ede2cf"`,

- the color of the narrative text is black,

- the font-size of the narrative text is set to 1.8em,

- the font-family of the narrative text uses a serif font.

In particular, the background color of the sidebar that I chose was intentional:
I wanted to have a color that matched the sand tones of the cobblestones in the 
ground as well as the blocks of the wall.


All of these formatting details are specified in the yaml header:

```yaml
